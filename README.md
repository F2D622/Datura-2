### Mezo-medicinal Origins
“ill smelling medicinal coming out of ant hill” 
—Tucker, Arthur O., and Jules Janick. Flora of the Codex Cruz-Badianus

Datura Stramonium is a plant with cross cultural legacies and potent poisonous potential. In its distribution today it ranges various continents, climate zones, and soil types. As identified within the Codex Cruz-Badianus by Arthur Tucker and Janick Jules, it is drawn curiously with a root crowded by orange ants. Visible are also its multi-pointed leaf structure, seed capsule, and white flowers. More than simply wrapping around this plant's roots, the ants (identified as Forelius Pruinosus) fall off errant ends and seem to come from all directions to arrive at its base. As we will see, these ants serve multiple purposes as a representational tool. For one they are an identifying element for would be foragers to spot this banal leafed plant among others, and since the plant can thrive in multiple rocky or nutrient poor soils, they might have been a more salient character by which to spot it. They are also a warning sign, a signifier of the deliriant toxins that remain locked in the plant's tissue; warding off easy capture of chemicals most concentrated in the datura roots. However the ants also can be seen as a simulacra for multiple human and animal agents that combine to form this plant's use, nomenclature, and cosmology.

### Morphology
Datura is a flowering annual that often forms an erect freely branching form reaching between 60-150 cm in height. Its flowers bloom throughout the summer, and form 6-8 cm long white and violet hues. Their nectar, which emits a pleasant fragrance, and are fed upon by nocturnal moths, a factor that perhaps contributes to one common name: Moon Flower. The branches also form simple, pinnately lobed, and alternate leaves; each with several acute tips. The seeds of this plant coalesce in hard spiked pods, holding around 150 seeds. Each shell can be from 3-8 cm in diameter and eventually splits into four chambers when ripe, revealing a poperie of black seeds to be plucked by small birds. The birds then distribute these seeds through digestion or error, which can lie dormant underground for years before germinating. In this soil the roots form an extensive, many branching, but shallow taproot system; ranging from green to purple in color. While the history of datura points to its survival veracity in trash or unwanted ecological milieu it will grow more perniciously in rich, calcareous soil, with added nitrogen increasing the concentration of alkaloids present in the plant. 

### Cultural Connotations
As it is commonly known today, Datura Stramonium goes by many english sudenyms: Thorn Apple, Jimsonweed (Jimson Weed), Devil's Snare, Moon Flower, Hell's Bells, Devil's Trumpet, Devil's Weed, Tolguacha, Jamestown Weed, Stinkweed, Locoweed, Prickly Burr, False Castor Oil Plant, Devil's Cucumber, and Mad Apple. 

This entomology clearly signifies its most salient socio-cultural aspects; those of religiosity, evil, invasiveness, deception, nighttime, and psychosis. The plant can be seen in the artwork of the American artist Georgia O’keeffe (Jimson weed/white flower no. 1. 1936). In the large format painting the Datura flowers swirl around each other, showing different stages in the plant's growth. The close cropped frame and floating context could denote a link to the psychic use throughout indigenous peoples across the American southwest. 

The Italian techno-pop group “Datura,” took its name from the eponymous plant. This late twentieth century music group included within their album descriptions of hallucinations caused by the so-called “devil's weed,” and espoused its potential for cosmic certainty. 

### Delirious Use
California’s colonial history has recounted the use of Datura for ceremonial uses among the idigenous people. Dried roots from the plant were steeped in water to create a powerful tea. The drink was ingested with careful consultation with elders and experienced tribal leaders: “Tribal leaders had each initiate purify himself, drink the hallucinogenic drug toloache (Datura), and then dance until unconscious. This often produced a colorful, mystical vision.” This process, cited as being called, “pa’nish mani,” or simply, “mani,” was one of the most significant initial steps for initiation. 

Finally, a curious case of colonial Datura use occurred in 1676 during the Rebellion of Bacon. Soldiers stationed at the encampment boiled the leaves and consumed them in a salad. Delirium immediately took effect, and several men spent the next eleven days in an altered delirious state. According to Robert Beverly in the History and Present State of Virginia, “In this frantic condition they were confined, lest they should, in their folly, destroy themselves – though it was observed that all their actions were full of innocence and good nature... thousand such simple tricks they played, and after 11 days returned to themselves again, not remembering anything that had passed.”

### Animal Actors
Aside from human consumers, many different species of birds, ants, and moths play an integral part in the life cycle and cosmology of Datura. Small birds have been seen plucking and consuming the seeds of open Datura pods. These seeds, which eventually reach soil through the avian digestion, can lie dormant underground for many years — germinating only when the soil is disturbed. This in part contributes to their identity as a ‘weed,’ and explains much of the plants’ robust repopulation in tough terrain. 

Night moths are another winged ally. Attracted to the nectar of the flowing Datura, these creatures hover and pollinate its stamen. By relying on ambient light, these moths activity can be greatly enhanced or altered by the lunar cycle. Thus another peculiar way in which the animal cosmos enters the Datura. 

Finally, the ants so wonderfully depicted in the Codex Cruz-Badianus are thought to be of the species, Forelius Pruinosus or “High Noon Ant”. This extremely common grounding ant forms large polygynous underground nests. Notably the ant shares a predilection for disturbed sites, which have loose and open soil through which to burrow. Disorganized soil craters may form at the entrance to their colonies, perhaps forming as the most immediate visual clue for the Codex artists to draw from. Although research remains scant on the exact relationship between Forelius and Datura, studies have shown other plants use these ants as bodyguards, leaving behind a nectar on leaves and stems to deter hungry caterpillars who would otherwise eat their leaves. Pruinosus translated directly means, “covered with hoarfrost,” and it is this prepubescent that probably deters other creatures from venturing too close to the ants home and potential food source. 

### Codex Creatures
The ants specific orange color, cratering soil, and potential to crawl over the plant explain to some extent the reason for their significance in the codex. It is also probably the case that these ants, in place of typical geomorphic soil characteristics in the codex, imply an a-site relationship for Datura. They signify the disturbed, wild, and diffuse habitat potential. They may also signify that because of the extreme delirious and dangerous potential of the Datura, that a more unique attribution was required in order to identify it for potential use across the ocean in Spain. The ants then are both a literal significance of the plants symbiotic relationships, but also a mimetic simulacra of its important classification. At the very bottom right of the image one ant can be seen painted upside down it seems, while another below it is completely off the roots. Therein could lie another message, one of potential death, and perhaps, as was the case with Jamestown, potential spread of toxic consequences outside of the colony. 

Harvard Herbaria Record
One of the more well preserved and documented specimens of Datura Stramonium was first collected by Emilie Francis Williams in Tiverton, Rhode Island, September 27th, 1903. Emilie is described as a Boston based oriental rug importer, amateur botanist and Chinese porcelain collector. His more famous accolade would be one year after collecting this sample, that is to marry the noted archeologist Blanche Wheeler Williams. The sample was donated some years later to the then named Gray Herbarium, and where it now sits; two branches with a sectioned seed pod. Mature and juvenile leaves can be seen in the pressing, most probably taken from the uppermost branches; while the main stem, roots, and soil are entirely absent. While the herbaria sheet records a limited slice of real plant matter for posterity, its limits are evident in the lack of contextual, biological, and cultural milieu that make up what Datura represents.
